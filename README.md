## Step 3: Selecting theme

Search up "Appearance" in "Menu". Double click "Custom" then click Customize. A new box should appear. Click the "Icons" tab and double click "Pwnbox"


## Step 4: Customising the Panel

On the top panel of your system, right click the three system monitors graphs (the ones with all those lines). Select "Remove from Panel".

### To get the 'ping panel'

Right click on a blank space on the top panel and choose "Add to Panel". In the search bar, type "command", select it and then click add. The time should show on the top panel. Right click on it, click Prefereces and in the command section, paste in `/opt/panel.sh` and change the interval to 5 seconds. It should show "HTB VPN: Disconnected" unless you're on a HTB VPN.

### To get the "processor" menu

Right click on a blank space on the top panel and search for "System monitor". Select it and add it. Right click on the little black box that appeared, select "preferences" and under "System monitor width", update it to "135" pixels, and update "System monitor update interval" "100" milliseconds. Under Monitor Resources. Check Network and Load.

## Step 5: Background

Saving the best for last!

Double click htb.jpg which is inside the github repo we installed. Click the image tab and click "Set as Desktop Background"

## Enjoy!

Hope this tutorial was easy for you!
